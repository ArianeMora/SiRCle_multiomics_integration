Always happy to hear feedback and suggestions :)


Links to manuscript data and outputs
------------------------------------

We did our best to make everything as reproducible as possible but if you notice anything that isn't please let us know!
Same with the code we did our best to ensure it all runs, so if it doesn't please let us know and we will update it ASAP.

Information
===========
This site hosts the information associated with the paper: **SiRCle (Signature Regulatory Clustering) model integration reveals mechanisms of phenotype regulation in renal cancer**.
Here we provide the code and data used for all the analyses in the paper and link to the packages we developed as part of
producing the paper. Note the code in **manuscript_reproducibility** is from prior to our revision. While **to_publish_clean** is
 all the notebooks and HTML outputs from every figure in the paper.

We also have all data, code and everything on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/14176842>`_.
