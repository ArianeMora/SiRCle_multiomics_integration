Installing SiRCle
=================

Code for our scircm package is available at `sci-RCM <https://github.com/ArianeMora/scircm>`_, documentation are at
`sci-RCM docs <https://arianemora.github.io/scircm/>`_.


Note: It is strongly recommended to create a `virtual environment <https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>`_
for each version of sci-vae and sci-RCM installed.

Python using pip
----------------
.. code-block:: python

    pip install scircm



R
--
I will add it as an R package soon, but until then check out the R example using Reticulate at the (`docs <https://arianemora.github.io/scivae/>`_.)!

**Note**: if you are using R you need to make sure you have python installed. We strongly recommend using `anaconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html/>`_
and creating an envrironment and then installing scivae in a particular envrionment using `reticulate <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/>`_.

Checkout the examples in R for more details.
